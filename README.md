Express and MongoDB
Express and MongoDB are big words for a person who has never touched any server-side programming in their life. Let’s quickly introduce what they are before we diving into the tutorial.

Express is a framework for building web applications on top of Node.js. It simplifies the server creation process that is already available in Node. In case you were wondering, Node allows you to use JavaScript as your server-side language.

MongoDB is a database. This is the place where you store information for your websites (or applications).

Getting started:
Start by creating a folder for this project. 
Feel free to call it anything you want. 
After you’ve created the folder, navigate into it with the Terminal and run npm init.
npm init creates a package.json file which helps you manage dependencies (which we will install as we go through the tutorial).

Running Node for the first time in your life:
The simplest way to use node is to run the node command, and specify a path to a file. 
Let’s create a file called index.js to run node with.

Using Express:
First, we have to install Express and all materils. 
We can do this by running the npm install command.
(npm is installed with Node, which is why you use commands like npm init and npm install).

Run npm install express --save command in your command line.

Now, run node index.js and navigate to localhost:3000 on your browser.

MongoDB:
MongoDB is a database.
npm install mongodb --save
